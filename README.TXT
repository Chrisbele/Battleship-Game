This was a project I made at my second semester in University.When the game starts
the player can place the ships by himself or he has the option to let the computer
place them randomly.During the game you play against the computer and at the beginning 
of every round it asks from the user to give coordinates about the next hit.In every user
input it checks if the input is valid and it prints the appropriate message.Finally it prints
a statistics board.
